To complete the Data Science minor, you are required to have a portfolio.

The course Data Science 401, which is a 1-credit course, is designed to help you fulfill this portfolio requirement. You will receive a grade for completing DS 401.

Your portfolio must feature at least three projects or assignments from the courses you've taken as part of the Data Science minor. These should highlight your skills and competencies in data science.

Creating a website for your portfolio is optional; it's not a mandatory requirement.

In DS 401, you'll be given two assignments specifically aimed at helping you build the content for your portfolio.


## Assignment 1: Informal Presentation

Due date will be announced once we finalize the course meeting times for Fall 2023.

For this informal presentation, your assignment is to guide us through the Data Science courses you've completed (or currently in progress or expect to take next term). For each course, describe its focus in terms of Data Science concepts and skills (e.g., "The course focused on basic data wrangling using R" or "We delved into econometrics, emphasizing regression analysis for cross-sectional and panel data").

Next, showcase 3-4 projects you've chosen from these courses. Be prepared to share these projects on screen. At the very least, have some data visualizations (basic plots and/or tables are okay) ready to display. For each project, briefly outline the following:

1. Questions or Goals: What were you aiming to investigate or achieve?
2. Data: What dataset did you work with?
3. Analytical Approach: What methods or techniques did you use?
4. Basic Results: What were the key findings?

This presentation will help us understand your Data Science journey and the skills you've acquired.

You should confine your presentation to 10 minutes so that we have a bit of time for questions/discussion.




## Assignment 2: Reflective Essay

This reflective essay should be a more extended, detailed, and carefully considered version of what you present to the group.  That is, you should use it to describe your trajectory through the DS minor.  Please tell us about each course, what you learned in it (skills, yes, but more important still, ideas about data analysis - e.g., "I learned how to use TWFE with panel data to deal simultaneously with unobserved time-invariant, unit-varying confounders and with unit-invariant, time-varying confounders, leaving only time-and-unit-varying confounders potentially omitted" or "I learned that a valid instrumental variable has to meet 4, only partially testable, assumptions: relevance, monotonicity, ignorability, and the exclusion restriction, and realized that in many applications these assumptions are not fully met" or "I learned how to use DAGs to express the researcher's qualitative assumptions about potential patterns of influence across a range of variables, from which we can deduce whether, conditional on those assumptions, a causal effect is identifiable and how" or "I learned about object-oriented programming, different kinds of object classes, how to write functions, and some basic tools for importing, cleaning, wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data").  Please also briefly discuss (a) any projects from that course you will include in your portfolio; (b) what their objectives were; (c) what you learned from them; and (d) their strengths and limitations as you see them today.  Please do not include the actual projects, plots, etc., in this essay.

Your essay should be carefully written, with proper grammar and in good style.  It needn't, and probably shouldn't, have a thesis, but it should nonetheless be organized.  Write as yourself, in the first person, in your own (professional and scholarly) voice.  The essay should be approximately 5-7 pages long.
