## Portfolio Requirement  

To complete the Data Science minor, you are required to have a portfolio.

The course Data Science 401, which is a 1-credit course, is designed to help you fulfill this portfolio requirement. You will receive a grade for completing DS 401.

Your portfolio must feature at least three projects or assignments from the courses you've taken as part of the Data Science minor. These should highlight your skills and competencies in data science.

Creating a website for your portfolio is optional; it's not a mandatory requirement. The portfolio also may be a set of PDFs instead of a website.

## Course Overview for Data Science 401

The first part of DS 401 is structured to help you reflect on your trajectory through the minor. The second part of DS 401 is structured to help with the technical aspects of preparing your portfolio.

In DS 401, you'll be given three assignments specifically aimed at helping you build the content for your portfolio.


## Assignment 1: Informal Presentation

The informal presentations will be during the weeks of October 2 and October 14. (Exact dates depend upon meeting time TBD.) Since there are 7 people in the class: 3 or 4 will present during the week of October 2, and the remainder will present during the week of October 14.

For this informal presentation, your assignment is to guide us through the Data Science courses you've completed (or currently in progress or expect to take next term). For each course, describe its focus in terms of Data Science concepts and skills (e.g., "The course focused on basic data wrangling using R" or "We delved into econometrics, emphasizing regression analysis for cross-sectional and panel data").

Next, showcase 3-4 projects you've chosen from these courses. Be prepared to share these projects on screen. At the very least, have some data visualizations (basic plots and/or tables are okay) ready to display. For each project, briefly outline the following:

1. Questions or Goals: What were you aiming to investigate or achieve?
2. Data: What dataset did you work with?
3. Analytical Approach: What methods or techniques did you use?
4. Basic Results: What were the key findings?

This presentation will help us understand your Data Science journey and the skills you've acquired.

You should confine your presentation to 10 minutes so that we have a bit of time for questions/discussion.




## Assignment 2: Reflective Essay

Due October 20 via Canvas.

Start by outlining each course you've taken as part of the minor, focusing not just on the skills you've acquired, but also on key ideas and insights you've gained in data analysis. For instance, you could discuss learning advanced techniques (e.g., "I learned how to use TWFE with panel data to deal simultaneously with unobserved time-invariant, unit-varying confounders and with unit-invariant, time-varying confounders, leaving only time-and-unit-varying confounders potentially omitted" or "I learned that a valid instrumental variable has to meet 4, only partially testable, assumptions: relevance, monotonicity, and the exclusion restriction, and realized that in many applications these assumptions are not fully met" or "I learned how to use DAGs to express the researcher's qualitative assumptions about potential patterns of influence across a range of variables, from which we can deduce whether, conditional on those assumptions, a causal effect is identifiable and how" or "I learned about object-oriented programming, different kinds of object classes, how to write functions, and some basic tools for importing, cleaning, wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data").

For each course in the minor that you've taken, please also briefly discuss:

1. Projects: Mention any projects from that course you plan to include in your portfolio.
  
2. Objectives: What were the objectives of these projects?
  
3. Learning Outcomes: What insights or skills did you gain from these projects?

4. Strengths and Limitations: Reflect on what you see as the strengths and limitations of these projects, as you understand them today.

Please note that you should not include the actual projects, plots, or other supplementary material in this essay. The focus should be on your reflections and insights.

Your essay should be well-structured and clearly written, adhering to proper grammar and a professional, scholarly style. While it doesn't necessarily need to have a thesis, it should still have a logical flow. Write in the first person and use your own voice. Aim for a length of approximately 5-7 pages.

## Assignment 3: In-Class Portfolio Presentation

 ### Assignment Description: In-Class Portfolio Presentation

The formal presentations of your portfolios will be during the weeks of November 13 and November 26 (before and after Thanksgiving week). (Exact dates depend upon meeting time TBD.) Since there are 7 people in the class: 3 or 4 will present during the week of November 13, and the remainder will present during the week of November 26.

#### Objective:
The aim of this assignment is for you to present your Data Science portfolio to the class. This presentation will offer a structured yet personalized overview of your academic journey in the Data Science minor, as well as highlight your key projects and competencies. If you've created a website for your portfolio, you may include a brief walkthrough.  

This final presentation serves as a bookend to the informal presentation you did in assignment #1. 

 
#### Assessment Criteria:

- Clarity and Organization: Is the presentation well-structured and easy to follow?
- Content Relevance: Do the projects and courses highlight your Data Science skills and competencies?
- Q&A: Is the presenter able to effectively answer questions and provide further clarity if needed?

 ## Final Task: Uploading project and materials to Canvas

Due before the end of finals week.

You are responsible, by the end of term, of ensuring that the DS portfolio requirements (at least 3 projects) are uploaded to Canvas.  If you have been completing the assignments as scheduled, you should already have the necessary content for your portfolio by the end of the term. Even if you have a website for your portfolio, you are still required to upload the projects to Canvas.

## Tips on Structure of Portfolio

A web portfolio is entirely optional. However, you must submit your portfolio as a set of files via Canvas. (Further details on upload instructions will be provided in class.) Even if you have a web portfolio, you must also submit the "print" portfolio as files.

In reflective essay, use subheadings to identify sections where you discuss each course or project.
