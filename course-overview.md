To complete the Data Science minor, you are required to have a portfolio.

The course Data Science 401, which is a 1-credit course, is designed to help you fulfill this portfolio requirement. You will receive a grade for completing DS 401.

Your portfolio must feature at least three projects or assignments from the courses you've taken as part of the Data Science minor. These should highlight your skills and competencies in data science.

Creating a website for your portfolio is optional; it's not a mandatory requirement.

In DS 401, you'll be given two assignments specifically aimed at helping you build the content for your portfolio.


## Assignment 1: Informal Presentation

For this informal presentation, your task is to walk us carefully through the sequence of DS courses you have taken.  For each, please tell us what the course was about from a DS perspective (e.g., “we worked on basic data wrangling and tidying skills in R” or “we covered the basic subject matter of econometrics, with a focus on regression analysis for cross-sectional and panel data).  Then, please tell us about the 3-4 projects you’ve selected.  You should have these, or at least some basic plots and/or tables that represent the well, available to share on screen.  For each project, provide a brief overview of its (a) quetions(s) and/or goals; (b) data; (c) analytical approach; and (d) basic results.

You should confine your presentation to 10 minutes so that we have a bit of time for questions/discussion.
