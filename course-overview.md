To complete the Data Science minor, you are required to have a portfolio.

The course Data Science 401, which is a 1-credit course, is designed to help you fulfill this portfolio requirement. You will receive a grade for completing DS 401.

Your portfolio must feature at least three projects or assignments from the courses you've taken as part of the Data Science minor. These should highlight your skills and competencies in data science.

Creating a website for your portfolio is optional; it's not a mandatory requirement.

In DS 401, you'll be given two assignments specifically aimed at helping you build the content for your portfolio.
