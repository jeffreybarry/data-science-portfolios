## Schedule Fall 2023

Since we're getting a bit of late start, this class will meet only 5 times during Fall Term. (Normally, the class would have 6 sessions every other week.) We will aim for each class session to be less than one hour.

Tentatively, we will meet at a time to be determined during the following weeks:

Week of October 2: informal presentations by 3 or 4 students.

Week of October 15: informal presentations by 3 or 4 students.

Week of October 30: technical Q&A on portfolio. (Videos on portfolio building will be provided prior to this session.)

Week of November 13: formal portfolio presentation by 3 or 4 students.

Week of November 26: formal portfolio presentation by 3 or 4 students.

The essay will be due mid-term.
